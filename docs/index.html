    <p>I have long been interested in Information Technology ever since I was a small child. Growing up, I found devices
        such as computers, mobile phones along with other tech gadgets quite intriguing. This curiosity would then drive
        me to finding out more about computers and how they functioned. Although I had growing interests for other
        fields such as sports and art, along the road, IT was the one thing I always had the most interest for.
    </p>
    <p> Given that I have had a lot more experience in it, I would have to say that my strongest point is programming.
        When it comes to general skills, I believe that I excel in problem solving and creative thinking.
        In the context of this project, it is fair to say that my web programming skills aren’t as profound.</p>
    <p>
        I generally attempt to contribute in all areas of a group project, however, in this case, I will probably be
        more invested in design related tasks and managing github.

    <p>Growing up I have always been around technology through the use of computers and iPads throughout my schooling.
        Since then I have been interested in learning about how to use these tools and how to learn about the different
        ways I could use them. I have also always looked up to my Dad who works in the field of Information Technology,
        which inspired me to undertake Information Technology at RMIT in 2020. Since deciding that I would undertake
        Information Technology at RMIT, I decided to complete Software Development as a VCE subject in 2019.
    </p>

    <p>I believe that I am good at working with others in a team as well as clearly communicating with team members and
        playing an active role as a team member. I also believe that I am a quick learner when working with people who I
        can easily communicate with and learn from.
        I have always been interested in learning about how Information Technology is used and applied in everyday
        situations such as how a small store or business would utilise IT as part of their daily operations.
        In line with our current idea, fashion and clothing has always been a close interest of mine as I have loved
        learning and being inspired by the stories of different fashion brands.
    </p>

    <p> Having little experience with programming and web design, I am still learning the basics of creating various
        applications and using languages such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
        Given my little experience in programming and web building, I expect to be attempting to code certain features
        of our project myself while also receiving advice and guidance from other team members with much more
        experience. However, I believe that I will be able to play a stronger part in developing our project idea and
        establishing our approach and plan to creating our project.

    <p>I have always been passionate about technology throughout my life, my first interest was video games, ever since
        I was young I have always been interested in game in general and I think this acted as a gateway for me into
        other areas of IT. Growing up I would often try different things in the area of IT such as basic photoshop and
        video editing software that I found interesting and entertaining. As I got older I started getting more
        interested in programming and this is where I think my future lies within the industry as I find programming in
        general very interesting and challenging.

    </p>

    <p>Over the past couple of years I think I have become fairly proficient programming at a beginner level and hope to
        improve these skills moving forward. I am a harder worker and like to perform well at tasks which I lend well to
        this kind work with more definitive measures of success and milestones. I also have a fairly good beginner level
        understanding of web design and user centered design. I believe I also work well in a team and good at
        contributing to work and helping others when necessary
    </p>

    <p>In relation to this project I think the report writing clear and succinct write ups would be a challenge for me.
        I expect to perform a role that relates to the programming and development of the software in this project. I
        think that a role like this could fit in with my skills well and would provide a good challenge for me moving
        forward.

    <p>Passion for IT began with, like most peers, video-gaming. 
        As a child I was exposed to gaming by siblings and had a natural talent for it. This passion was further 
        reinforced by being the ‘IT nerd’ in my household, as my family would often ask me for help regarding 
        technology. Later on, I began becoming more involved in the IT industry, making friends revolving around IT, 
        and eventually seeing myself work in the industry.
    </p>

    <p>My strong points are HTML and CSS, as I was assigned the designated web designer for previous projects. 
        Although my interests lean more towards programming, as in the future I hope to program my own game, 
        I find myself being able to web design with much more ease. In a team, my communication skills is most likely
        my strongest point. I believe that I can work well with any team and can communicate easily with different types 
        of people.
    </p>

    <p>This project requires a basic understanding of javascript, and despite having an interest in programming, 
        javascript is my weakest point. I expect to be given a role around the formation of the website design, 
        and generally helping with any programming features. This would provide a challenge for me and also spur on
        my growth regarding my programming skills.
